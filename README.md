# Basic Web Deploy
Deploying website means showing web to the internet. In the beginning of internet, deploying web was complicated since you have to manually configure server, insert html, and many more headache. Now you can deploy with Github pages for basic static web or do CI/CD on public cloud service.

# How to start deploying
1. fork this repo into your account
2. click "Settings" tab
3. scroll page to "Github Pages"
4. change "Source" from None to master branch
5. Get creative and go explore to infinity and <b> beyond. </b>

# Misc
- It is possible that Github Pages failed to deploy your webpage. In case of that, please try to rename .html file into .md file. Other way is make blank 'index.md' file. You can delete it later anyway.
